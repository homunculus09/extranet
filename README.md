# Extranet Themes
Hey Welcome to the Extranet Themes page. This is a project that offers themes for the extranet via a bookmarklet.
More themes and Chromium & Firefox extensions comming soon :)

### Getting Started
Currently, only one theme is available (which is still in beta), so bear with me.
1. Head over to [default-dark/default-dark-bookmarklet.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homunculus09/extranet-themes/refs/heads/main/default-dark/default-dark-bookmarklet.js)
2. Copy all the text
3. Head over to _any_ website and save the website to bookmarks or the bookmark bar folder.
4. Enable the bookmarks bar if not already done by pressing **CTRL + SHIFT + B**
5. Right click or hold down the bookmark in your bookmarks bar and press on **Edit**.
6. Paste the code into the URL entry space
7. Rename the bookmark to _anything_ like **Dark** or **Extranet Dark Theme**
8. Click on Save or Done and you've just made a bookmarklet.
9. Head over to extranet, and press the bookmarklet to enable the theme.
### FAQ
**What are bookmarklets?**
- Bookmarklets are small snippets of JavaScript code that run a script in your web browser's console.
- Bookmarklets live in your bookmarks bar, and all you need to do is tap on the bookmark each time you re-open the website.

**How does it work?**
- The code replaces the website's CSS code (on the client side, so this doesn't affect the site for anyone else) and changes the color values, fonts, font sizes, etc., within the site.

**Is this dangerous?**
- Not at all. The code is open-source, meaning you can inspect it yourself and check for anything malicious. We can't hide any dangerous files or code anywhere.
