Hey, welcome to the Extranet Themes page. This is a project that offers themes for the extranet via a bookmarklet.
More themes and Chromium & Firefox extensions comming soon :)

## FAQ
**What are bookmarklets?**
- Bookmarklets are small snippets of JavaScript code that run a script in your web browser's console.
- Bookmarklets live in your bookmarks bar, and all you need to do is tap on the bookmark each time you re-open the website.

**How does it work?**
- The code replaces the website's CSS code (on the client side, so this doesn't affect the site for anyone else) and changes the color values, fonts, font sizes, etc., within the site.

**Is this dangerous?**
- Not at all. The code is open-source, meaning you can inspect it yourself and check for anything malicious. We can't hide any dangerous files or code anywhere.
